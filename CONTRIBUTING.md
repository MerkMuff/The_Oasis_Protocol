# Contributing to The Souper Cycle

Welcome to the Guild. We are not just writing code; we are engineering peace.

## The Philosophy
We believe that abundance is an engineering problem, not a political one. If you are here, you are an **Architect** of a better world.

## How to Contribute

### 1. The "Dignity Protocol"
Before submitting a Pull Request, ask yourself:
* Does this code increase efficiency?
* Does this design respect the user's dignity?
* Is this system resilient?

### 2. Areas of Need
* **Thermodynamics:** Optimizing heat exchange ratios in the VMED simulation.
* **Power Systems:** Writing load-balancing algorithms for the Direct DC grid.
* **AI/ML:** optimizing knowledge distillation pipelines for low-power hardware.
* **Field Ops:** Designing the physical layout of the "Souper Container."

### 3. The Handshake
We operate on high trust. If you see something broken, fix it. If you have a crazy idea, propose it. We value **Intent** over bureaucracy.

## Pull Request Process
1. Fork the repo.
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`).
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`).
5. Open a Pull Request.
