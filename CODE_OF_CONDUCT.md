# Souper Code of Conduct: The Dignity Protocol

## Our Pledge
In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone.

## The Standard: "Honor & Handshakes"
We act with the assumption of positive intent. We treat each other with the dignity we wish to see in the world.

### Expected Behavior
* **Honesty:** Be transparent about technical limitations and risks.
* **Creativity:** Encourage wild ideas. "Crazy" is often just "Early."
* **Respect:** Disagreements are about ideas, not people.
* **Service:** We build to serve the communities that host our infrastructure.

### Unacceptable Behavior
* Withholding critical safety information.
* Use of the technology for coercion or harm.
* Personal attacks or trolling.

## Enforcement
The project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

**Contact:** The Souper Corporation Team.
